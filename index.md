As salamu alaikum brothers and sisters, my name is Osmanli. 
<br>
<br>
A little over a year ago I remember sitting in class on my laptop and stumbling across a list of contradictions within the bible. My memory is a little foggy, but I think it was a book by Ahmed Deedat (may Allah be pleased with all he has done for the community). I fondly remember turning to my friends who were Christian at the time, and presenting this sort of holy grail I had just found. It was beyond any of us that a holy book like the Bible could contain any sort of error, let alone contradiction, but lo and behold there it was. And two weeks following this I took my shahada (all thanks and praises to Allah). 
<br>
<br>
<br>
After witnessing the ill faith and blatant lies of both the Answering Islam, and Answering Christianity teams, I decided on creating this website (a) in opposition to poor academic practices, and (b) to honourably respond to allegations against Islam. I will now take an oath:
<br>
<br>
<span style="color:blue;">I swear by Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. My intentions are to justly, and righteously respond to allegations, accusations, imputations [et cetera], against the noble faith of Islam. I will not lie, nor will I conceal the truth. </span>  And Allah is my witness. It is my intention to clarify the truth, guide the creation, and offer mercy and goodness to the disbelievers. I will be harsh in condemning innovation and disobedience, and it is my duty to clarify what is in them of corruption and to warn the servants of Allah. This is my act of mercy and goodness, and not revenge nor vengeance.
<br>
<br>
> معي ثلاث خصال بها أظهر على خصمي أفرح إذا أصاب خصمي وَأحزن له إذا أخطأ وَأحفظ نفسي لا تتجاهل عَلَيْهِ <br>
> I have three traits that give me an advantage over my adversary. I rejoice when he is correct, I am saddened when he is wrong, and I guard myself from insulting him.
