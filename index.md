As salamu alaikum brothers and sisters, my name is Osmanli.

<br>
A little over a year ago I remember sitting in class on my laptop and stumbling across a list of contradictions within the bible. My memory is a little foggy, but I think it was a book by Ahmed Deedat (may Allah be pleased with all he has done for the community). I fondly remember turning to my friends who were Christian at the time, and presenting this sort of holy grail I had just found. It was beyond any of us that a holy book like the Bible could contain any sort of error, let alone contradiction, but lo and behold there it was. And two weeks following this I took my shahada (all thanks and praises to Allah).

<br>
<br>
After witnessing the ill faith and blatant lies of both the Answering Islam, and Answering Christianity teams, I decided on creating this website (a) in opposition to poor academic practices, and (b) to honourably respond to allegations against Islam. I will now take an oath:
<br>
<span style="color:blue;">I swear by Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. My intentions are to justly, and righteously respond to allegations, accusations, imputations [et cetera], against the noble faith of Islam. I will not lie, nor will I conceal the truth. </span>  And Allah is my witness.
