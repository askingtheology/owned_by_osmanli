## Establishment 
What is the Islamic Dilemma? Well, I will let the [Gospel-Centered-Discipleship](https://gcdiscipleship.com/article-feed/the-islamic-dilemma-a-game-changer-for-conversations-with-muslims) website explain.
<br><br>
<font color="blue">"The crux of the argument is this: The Qur’an affirms the inspiration, authority, and preservation of the New Testament Gospels; yet the Qur’an also contradicts the Gospels on major theological and historical points." Therefore, the Qur’an cannot be reliable.</font> 
## Quran 29:46
<font color="red">And do not argue with the People of the Scripture except in a way that is best, except for those who commit injustice among them, and say, "We believe in that which has been revealed to us and revealed to you. And our God and your God is one; and we are Muslims [in submission] to Him."</font> 
### Allah and the Trinity are One God?
**From the Gospel-Centered-Discipleship website:**
<br>
<font color="blue"> "From this verse we can see that Muslims are taught that their god and the God of the “people of the scripture” (Jews and Christians) are one and the same. However, as I’ve shown in my previous article, Muslims do not believe in the same God that Christians worship. Islam denies the very nature of God as a Trinity. The Quran more specifically denies the deity of Jesus in Surah 5:116."</font>

**Response:** No. The Quran was not revealed to reject the former books (The Torah and Injeel), but to confirm them.
<br>
<font color="red">And We have revealed to you, [O Muhammad], the Book in truth, confirming that which preceded it of the Scripture and as a criterion over it. So judge between them by what Allah has revealed and do not follow their inclinations away from what has come to you of the truth. To each of you We prescribed a law and a method. Had Allah willed, He would have made you one nation [united in religion], but [He intended] to test you in what He has given you; so race to [all that is] good. To Allah is your return all together, and He will [then] inform you concerning that over which you used to differ.</font>
