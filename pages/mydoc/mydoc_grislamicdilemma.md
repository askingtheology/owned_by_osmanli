## Establishment 
What is the Islamic Dilemma? Well, I will let the [Gospel-Centered-Discipleship](https://gcdiscipleship.com/article-feed/the-islamic-dilemma-a-game-changer-for-conversations-with-muslims) website explain.
<br><br>
<font color="blue">"The crux of the argument is this: The Qur’an affirms the inspiration, authority, and preservation of the New Testament Gospels; yet the Qur’an also contradicts the Gospels on major theological and historical points." Therefore, the Qur’an cannot be reliable.</font> 
<br><br>
## Quran 29:46
<font color="red">And do not argue with the People of the Scripture except in a way that is best, except for those who commit injustice among them, and say, "We believe in that which has been revealed to us and revealed to you. And our God and your God is one; and we are Muslims [in submission] to Him."</font> 
<br><br>
### Allah and the Trinity are One God?
#### Does <font color="red">And our God and your God is one</font> necessitate that Muslims believe in the Trinity?
